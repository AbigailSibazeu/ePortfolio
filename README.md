## Overview
This repository documents my process for developing my ePortfolio as part of the CS499 Computer Science Capstone final project. A professional portfolio is a powerful visual communication tool that highlights my unique skills and talents, effectively demonstrating my value to potential employers.
The ePortfolio serves as a strong foundation for showcasing my expertise across key areas of Computer Science. It includes artifacts from various courses in the Computer Science program, reflecting my growth in software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

Some artifacts highlight proficiency in a single category, while others demonstrate skills across multiple domains. As part of my professional development, I have refined and enhanced these artifacts beyond course requirements—improving their quality, addressing limitations, and mitigating vulnerabilities.
This portfolio not only showcases my technical abilities but also reflects my motivation, organization, and accomplishments as a Computer Science major specializing in Software Engineering.


## Self-Reflections

### Assignment One: Self-Introduction

This paper serves as an informative self-introduction, connecting key computer science concepts from my coursework to my personal experiences. It provides an opportunity to share my perspectives, reflect on course materials, and engage with concepts in a deeper, more meaningful way.

### Journal: Career Choice

This paper explores my career choices and future plans as shaped by the Computer Science program. It reflects on why I have remained committed to my career path, how my thinking has evolved, and the impact of research on my decision-making process.

### Journal: Capstone Reflection

This paper is a reflective submission for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course, documenting my journey through the assignments. I discuss how I achieved the five-course outcomes by enhancing the artifacts in my ePortfolio and successfully creating a professional portfolio that demonstrates my knowledge, skills, and abilities.

### ePortfolio Selection and Software Design Document

This paper outlines my initial plan for meeting the ePortfolio requirements. While not the final version, it serves as a strong foundation with well-defined ideas for further refinement. This assignment represents the beginning of a structured process aimed at developing a compelling ePortfolio that showcases my skills across key areas of computer science:

Software engineering and design,
Algorithms and data structure,
Databases

## Code Review

For each artifact selected in my initial plan, I conduct a detailed code review in a video format. In these reviews, I analyze existing code to identify weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities, while outlining my planned enhancements. Each code review provides a structured walk-through of the existing implementation and planned improvements, demonstrating the following key elements:

Existing Functionality – A comprehensive walk-through of the current code, focusing on its features and functionality.
Code Analysis – Identification of areas for improvement, including structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documentation.
Enhancements – A discussion of planned improvements that address the issues identified during code analysis.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

This paper provides a narrative accompanying the artifact enhancements in the area of software design and engineering. It explains why the selected artifact was included in this category of the ePortfolio and reflects on the process of its development. The narrative highlights key learning experiences gained through the artifact’s creation.
The artifact showcases my ability to apply innovative design techniques and implement solutions effectively. It demonstrates proficiency in programming solutions that address software logic challenges, resolve potential design flaws, and enhance security.

### Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancement

This paper presents a narrative detailing the enhancements made to an artifact in the algorithms and data structures category. It explains the rationale for selecting this artifact and provides insights into the development process. The focus is on the learning gained during its creation and refinement.
The artifact itself involves the design and implementation of authentication and authorization mechanisms within a monitoring system. It ensures secure user access based on credentials and manages role-based interactions across different modules and functionalities.

### Databases Enhancement
This paper provides a narrative describing the enhancements made to an artifact in the databases category. It explains why the artifact was selected and reflects on the development process, emphasizing key takeaways.
The artifact features a multi-tier application leveraging the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and a RESTful API. A key focus of this enhancement is the separation of concerns, which improves system maintainability and scalability. By refining the database structure and API interactions, the artifact enhances data integrity, security, and performance.
